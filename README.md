POLICYGRAPH AI 2.0 bridges the gap between complex government policy documents and citizen understanding through explainable AI. The system serves two integrated intelligence layers:

Citizen Intelligence Layer: Enables transparent eligibility evaluation for government schemes with explainable reasoning
Governance Intelligence Layer: Provides policy complexity scoring and conflict detection for policymakers

The Problem
Government welfare schemes and scholarship programs often have complex, nested eligibility criteria buried in dense policy documents. Citizens struggle to determine eligibility, while policymakers lack tools to identify inconsistencies, contradictions, and unnecessary complexity across schemes.
The Solution
POLICYGRAPH AI 2.0 uses neuro-symbolic AI to:
Parse policy documents and extract eligibility conditions with source grounding (no hallucinations)
Convert natural language rules into structured, machine-interpretable logic
Evaluate citizen eligibility with explainable reasoning traces citing exact clauses
Detect 5 types of policy conflicts with severity classification
Measure complexity on 6 dimensions with 0-100 scoring
Surface ambiguity and uncertainty explicitly with confidence scores
